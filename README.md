# woot-test

 It is a scenario that returns a big json object that includes all the characters stats and skills given in the example 
 of the test.(no time for ui or design is just plain json)
## Requirements

I haven't gotten yet to create a docker environment, so you will need:

- Composer
- PHP 8 or higher
- MySQL

## Install
 
  1. clone project
  2. composer install 
  3. copy the .env.example file into .env file with the needed data to connect to db
  4. run the structure of the db into your database (config/ddl.sql)
  5. run the values for the db into your database (config/dml.sql)
  4. Yey! Configured. :) 

## About

The mini-mini app follows a character "Courier", that gets stats and skills autogenerated from database.
After that 20 "Packages" appear... also with stats and skills autogenerated, characters that "Courier" must fight 
to succeed. Then the game sets a path to "Courier" by sorting "Packages" based on PRIORITY and their LUCK so our main 
character has a better view on how to approach challenges.
So round and round "Courier" fight to get to the finish and be successfull...In every round each get their turn and apply
skills if they are lucky enough.
Sometimes he makes it, sometimes not so lucky....Give it a shot, see how lucky "Courier" is indeed or you can poke around in the 
db and make him luckier and stronger :D.
